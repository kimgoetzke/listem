# Privacy Policy for Listem

_Last updated: 21st April 2024_

This Privacy Policy explains how Listem ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects the personal information of
users ("you" or "your") of our mobile application ("Listem" or "the application").

## 1. Information we collect

Listem collects the following types of information from users:

- **User account information**: When you create an account on Listem, we collect the username and password chosen by
  you. We do not require or collect any additional personal information such as email addresses or names.
- **List and item data**: Listem allows you to create and manage lists and items within the application.
- **Usage data**: We, or third party services employed in this application, may temporarily collect your application
  logs, your IP addresses or device id utilised of the device(s) accessing the application, the URI addresses (
  Uniform Resource Identifier), the time of the request, the method utilised to submit the request to the server, the
  numerical code indicating the status of the server's answer (successful outcome, error, etc.), your mobile phone's
  platform and platform version.

## 2. Use of information

We use the information collected from you for the following purposes:

- **Providing the Listem service**: We use your account information to authenticate you and provide access to the Listem
  service. Your list and item data are stored locally on your device and in our database to enable you to manage your
  lists and items within the application.
- **Improving and personalising the service**: We may use aggregated and anonymized data for analytical purposes to
  improve the Listem service.

## 3. Data storage and processing

Your list and item data are stored locally on your device using MongoDB Realm and synchronised to the cloud using
MongoDB Realm and Flexible Sync. The data is encrypted on your device, in transit, and in the cloud. The data is stored
in the cloud to allow you to access your data across multiple devices and to enable collaboration on shared lists which
is an optional feature that allows you to share a list with another Listem user or access a list of another Listem user
who decided to share a list with you. To learn more about MongoDB security and privacy practices, please
visit https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/trust. The physical location of the database storing any of your
application data is Ireland in AWS datacenters.

This is an open-source application. If you are interested to learn about the exact way in which any data in this
application is processed, you can view the source code of the application in this GitHub repository.

## 4. Data sharing

We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal process.

## 5. User rights

As a Listem user, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- **Access**: You can access and review the list and item data associated with your account within the Listem
  application.
- **Rectification**: You can update or correct your account information, except username and password, within the Listem
  application.
- **Erasure**: You can delete all data that we hold on you via the application. See
  [How to delete your account](how-to-delete-your-account.md) for more information.

Please note that you cannot modify your username, reset your password or request a password reset. Due to the high
degree of privacy we provide, we cannot identify account owners ourselves and therefore cannot verify the legitimacy
of any request to change username or password.

## 6. Children's privacy

We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

Listem does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you
think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us
immediately, and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
